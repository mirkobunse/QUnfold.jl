TODO.


## Getting started

QUnfold.jl can be installed through the Julia package manager. From the Julia REPL, type `]` to enter the Pkg mode of the REPL. Then run

```
pkg> add QUnfold
```

You can then start to quantify / unfold the data you have:

```julia
using QUnfold

# TODO
```


## Citing

This implementation is a part of my Ph.D. thesis.
